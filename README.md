Sure, here is an example of what the README.md file for this facemask detection application might look like:

# Face Mask Detection using OpenCV and SVM

This Python application uses computer vision techniques to detect whether a person is wearing a facemask or not. It is built using libraries like NumPy and OpenCV, and implements a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to distinguish between images of faces with masks and without masks. 

## Usage

The application is divided into two parts: data collection and mask detection. The data collection script captures images from the user's webcam and saves them to a NumPy array. The mask detection script loads the data, trains the SVM classifier, and uses the webcam to detect faces in real-time, displaying the predicted mask/no-mask label on the screen.

To use the application, simply run the data collection script and follow the instructions to collect data for both masked and unmasked faces. Once you have collected enough data, run the mask detection script to train the SVM classifier and start detecting masks in real-time.

## Dependencies

This application requires the following Python libraries:

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn
```
